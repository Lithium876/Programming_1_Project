# Programming 1 Project

A private health institution, Brockline Medical Centre (BMC), at any given day and time has a long line of patients waiting in its emergency department. The triage nurses manning the department wish to keep better track of those waiting in line and so its head nurse, Angela Dawson, has solicited your assistance with developing an emergency patient management system. The development is to take place on a phased basis with specific requirements for each phase.

*__Part 1__* of the project required you to determine the priority level of the patients and the severity of their emergency based on previously established criteria. Assume that the program for Part 1 has already been written accurately. Accomplish the requirements for Part 2 based on what is outlined below.

*__Part 2__* of the project asked you to determine the referral cost. Brockline has made some modifications to the previous requirements and now asks you to write a program that will accomplish the following:
* Process an unlimited number of patient records, up to a maximum of 50. A value of - 9 for the patient number should signal end of input.
* Accept from the user the patient number, priority level and referral code for the dayâ€™s visit
* Determine the referral cost based on the priority level and the referral code.
* Output for each record the patient number, priority level and referral cost.
* Also output the total in referral costs for each referral code, as well as the total number of patients seen for the day.

*__Part 3__* required you to process an unlimited number of records and determine, amongst other things, the referral cost for each patient. 

*__Part 4__* requires the use of arrays.
